## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to integrate a MySQL database into a command line application. 
- I built this project to better understand SQL logic.
- This project aims to create a command line application which, through the use of Inquirer, allows the user to interact with a MySQL database, performing a variety of functions.
- Through this project, I learned a lot about SQL logic, how to join tables together, how to filter data, and how to integrate that with user input.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the application's installation location in [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or similar command-line tool) and do the same.

To create the database, in the terminal start MySQL by running:

        mysql -u root -p

Then create the database by running:

        source ./db/schema.sql;
        source ./db/seeds.sql;
